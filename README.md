# Twitter Parsing Engine

All the old commits can be found at https://github.com/MahaBKT/Twitter-Messaging-Engine   
A new repo was created for a cleaned up project structure that includes all working files


We created our project in IntelliJ and build it using Maven (we have included the pom.xml) file. 

For our project we built a parser that would take the tweet from that the user would input once the program is run. Running the program prompts the user to enter a tweet that can include mentions, hashtags, and URLs. Once a tweet is inputted, the program then parses through the tweet and stores all the mentions, hastags, and URLs in theirown respective ArrayLists and then print out the ArrayList and its size for each.

The program can be run in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE that was used to create this project.
